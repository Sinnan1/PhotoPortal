# Gallery Pagination Implementation

## Overview
Converted the gallery photo view from infinite scroll to pagination for better user experience and performance.

## Why Pagination?

### Benefits for Photo Portals:
1. **Bookmarkable Pages** - Users can bookmark specific pages and return exactly where they left off
2. **Better Performance** - Keeps DOM lean by only rendering 50 photos at a time instead of accumulating thousands
3. **Mental Model** - "Page 3 of 10" is easier to remember than scroll position
4. **Shareable Links** - Users can share specific pages with others
5. **Memory Persistence** - Last viewed page is saved in localStorage per folder

## Changes Made

### State Management
- **Removed**: `displayedPhotos`, `loadingMore`, `hasMore` (infinite scroll state)
- **Simplified**: `currentPage` (pagination state)
- **Reduced**: `PHOTOS_PER_PAGE` from 100 to 50 for optimal performance

### Pagination Logic
```typescript
const paginatedPhotos = useMemo(() => {
  const startIndex = (currentPage - 1) * PHOTOS_PER_PAGE;
  const endIndex = startIndex + PHOTOS_PER_PAGE;
  return filteredPhotos.slice(startIndex, endIndex);
}, [filteredPhotos, currentPage, PHOTOS_PER_PAGE]);
```

### LocalStorage Integration
- Saves last viewed page per folder: `gallery-{galleryId}-folder-{folderId}-page`
- Automatically restores page when returning to a folder
- Resets to page 1 when changing filters

### UI Components
- **Removed**: Infinite scroll trigger, "Load All" button, loading indicators
- **Added**: Full pagination controls with First/Previous/Next/Last buttons
- **Added**: Smart page number display (shows 5 pages at a time with ellipsis)
- **Added**: Page counter showing "Page X of Y (Z total)"

### Pagination Controls
```
[First] [Previous] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] ... [10] [Next] [Last]
```
- Disabled states for first/last pages
- Active page highlighted
- Smart page range display based on current position

## Performance Improvements
- **DOM Size**: Max 50 photos rendered vs unlimited with infinite scroll
- **Memory Usage**: Constant memory footprint instead of growing
- **Scroll Performance**: No intersection observer overhead
- **Initial Load**: Faster first render with fewer photos

## User Experience
- Users can remember their position ("I was on page 3")
- Can jump directly to any page
- Browser back/forward works naturally
- Keyboard shortcuts possible (arrow keys for prev/next)
- No "lost position" on page refresh

## Future Enhancements
- Add URL query params for page number (e.g., `?page=3`)
- Preload next/previous page images in background
- Add keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys for navigation)
- Show thumbnail preview of each page
