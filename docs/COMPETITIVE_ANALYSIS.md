## Feature Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (Blockers for Professional Use)

#### 1. No Watermarking ❌ HIGH PRIORITY
**Why it matters**: Photographers lose thousands to image theft  
**Competitor solution**: All platforms offer customizable watermarks  
**Photo Portal gap**: No watermark capability  
**Impact**: Cannot safely showcase work to clients before payment

#### 2. No Selection Limits ❌ HIGH PRIORITY
**Why it matters**: Clients over-select, causing decision fatigue  
**Competitor solution**: Set limits like "Select up to 50 photos"  
**Photo Portal gap**: Unlimited selections  
**Impact**: Longer delivery times, unhappy clients with too many choices

#### 3. No Payment Integration ❌ HIGH PRIORITY
**Why it matters**: Professional photographers need to collect payment  
**Competitor solution**: Built-in Stripe, PayPal, package sales  
**Photo Portal gap**: External invoicing required  
**Impact**: Extra administrative work, delayed payments

#### 4. No Print Preparation ❌ MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY
**Why it matters**: Hours spent preparing files for print  
**Competitor solution**: Auto-generate print-ready files in multiple sizes  
**Photo Portal gap**: Manual work in Photoshop/Lightroom  
**Impact**: 2-3 hours extra work per wedding delivery

#### 5. Basic Gallery Customization ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Why it matters**: Professional branding builds trust  
**Competitor solution**: Custom colors, fonts, themes, white-label  
**Photo Portal gap**: Generic appearance  
**Impact**: Galleries don't reflect photographer's brand
